## Features

1. Async

    Relying on [SQLx](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx), SeaORM is a new library with async support from day 1.

2. Dynamic

    Built upon [SeaQuery](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-query), SeaORM allows you to build complex dynamic queries.

3. Service Oriented

    Quickly build services that join, filter, sort and paginate data in REST, GraphQL and gRPC APIs.

4. Production Ready

    SeaORM is feature-rich, well-tested and used in production by companies and startups.

## A quick taste of SeaORM

Let's have a quick walk through of the unique features of SeaORM.

### Entity
You don't have to write this by hand! Entity files can be generated from an existing database with `sea-orm-cli`,
following is generated with `--entity-format dense` (new in 2.0).
```rust
mod cake {
    use sea_orm::entity::prelude::*;

    #[sea_orm::model]
    #[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq, Eq, DeriveEntityModel)]
    #[sea_orm(table_name = "cake")]
    pub struct Model {
        #[sea_orm(primary_key)]
        pub id: i32,
        pub name: String,
        #[sea_orm(has_one)]
        pub fruit: HasOne<super::fruit::Entity>,
        #[sea_orm(has_many, via = "cake_filling")] // M-N relation with junction
        pub fillings: HasMany<super::filling::Entity>,
    }
}
mod fruit {
    use sea_orm::entity::prelude::*;

    #[sea_orm::model]
    #[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq, DeriveEntityModel, Eq)]
    #[sea_orm(table_name = "fruit")]
    pub struct Model {
        #[sea_orm(primary_key)]
        pub id: i32,
        pub name: String,
        #[sea_orm(unique)]
        pub cake_id: Option<i32>,
        #[sea_orm(belongs_to, from = "cake_id", to = "id")]
        pub cake: HasOne<super::cake::Entity>,
    }
}
```
### Entity Loader

The Entity Loader intelligently uses join for 1-1 and data loader for 1-N relations,
eliminating the N+1 problem even when performing nested queries.
```rust
// join paths:
// cake -> fruit
//      -> filling -> ingredient

let super_cake = cake::Entity::load()
    .filter_by_id(42) // shorthand for .filter(cake::Column::Id.eq(42))
    .with(fruit::Entity) // 1-1 uses join
    .with((filling::Entity, ingredient::Entity)) // 1-N uses data loader
    .one(db)
    .await?
    .unwrap();

// 3 queries are executed under the hood:
// 1. SELECT FROM cake JOIN fruit WHERE id = $
// 2. SELECT FROM filling JOIN cake_filling WHERE cake_id IN (..)
// 3. SELECT FROM ingredient WHERE filling_id IN (..)

super_cake
    == cake::ModelEx {
        id: 42,
        name: "Black Forest".into(),
        fruit: Some(
            fruit::ModelEx {
                name: "Cherry".into(),
            }
            .into(),
        ),
        fillings: vec![filling::ModelEx {
            name: "Chocolate".into(),
            ingredients: vec![ingredient::ModelEx {
                name: "Syrup".into(),
            }],
        }],
    };
```
### Select
SeaORM models 1-N and M-N relationships at the Entity level,
letting you traverse many-to-many links through a junction table in a single call.
```rust
// find all models
let cakes: Vec<cake::Model> = Cake::find().all(db).await?;

// find and filter
let chocolate: Vec<cake::Model> = Cake::find()
    .filter(cake::Column::Name.contains("chocolate"))
    .all(db)
    .await?;

// find one model
let cheese: Option<cake::Model> = Cake::find_by_id(1).one(db).await?;
let cheese: cake::Model = cheese.unwrap();

// find related models (lazy)
let fruit: Option<fruit::Model> = cheese.find_related(Fruit).one(db).await?;

// find related models (eager): for 1-1 relations
let cake_with_fruit: Vec<(cake::Model, Option<fruit::Model>)> =
    Cake::find().find_also_related(Fruit).all(db).await?;

// find related models (eager): works for both 1-N and M-N relations
let cake_with_fillings: Vec<(cake::Model, Vec<filling::Model>)> = Cake::find()
    .find_with_related(Filling) // for M-N relations, two joins are performed
    .all(db) // rows are automatically consolidated by left entity
    .await?;
```
### Nested Select

Partial models prevent overfetching by letting you querying only the fields
you need; it also makes writing deeply nested relational queries simple.
```rust
use sea_orm::DerivePartialModel;

#[derive(DerivePartialModel)]
#[sea_orm(entity = "cake::Entity")]
struct CakeWithFruit {
    id: i32,
    name: String,
    #[sea_orm(nested)]
    fruit: Option<fruit::Model>, // this can be a regular or another partial model
}

let cakes: Vec<CakeWithFruit> = Cake::find()
    .left_join(fruit::Entity) // no need to specify join condition
    .into_partial_model() // only the columns in the partial model will be selected
    .all(db)
    .await?;
```

### Insert
SeaORM's ActiveModel lets you work directly with Rust data structures and
persist them through a simple API.
It's easy to insert large batches of rows from different data sources.
```rust
let apple = fruit::ActiveModel {
    name: Set("Apple".to_owned()),
    ..Default::default() // no need to set primary key
};

let pear = fruit::ActiveModel {
    name: Set("Pear".to_owned()),
    ..Default::default()
};

// insert one: Active Record style
let apple = apple.insert(db).await?;
apple.id == 1;

// insert one: repository style
let result = Fruit::insert(apple).exec(db).await?;
result.last_insert_id == 1;

// insert many returning last insert id
let result = Fruit::insert_many([apple, pear]).exec(db).await?;
result.last_insert_id == Some(2);
```

### Insert (advanced)
You can take advantage of database specific features to perform upsert and idempotent insert.
```rust
// insert many with returning (if supported by database)
let models: Vec<fruit::Model> = Fruit::insert_many([apple, pear])
    .exec_with_returning(db)
    .await?;
models[0]
    == fruit::Model {
        id: 1, // database assigned value
        name: "Apple".to_owned(),
        cake_id: None,
    };

// insert with ON CONFLICT on primary key do nothing, with MySQL specific polyfill
let result = Fruit::insert_many([apple, pear])
    .on_conflict_do_nothing()
    .exec(db)
    .await?;

matches!(result, TryInsertResult::Conflicted);
```

### Update
ActiveModel avoids race conditions by updating only the fields you've changed,
never overwriting untouched columns.
You can also craft complex bulk update queries with a fluent query building API.
```rust
use fruit::Column::CakeId;
use sea_orm::sea_query::{Expr, Value};

let pear: Option<fruit::Model> = Fruit::find_by_id(1).one(db).await?;
let mut pear: fruit::ActiveModel = pear.unwrap().into();

pear.name = Set("Sweet pear".to_owned()); // update value of a single field

// update one: only changed columns will be updated
let pear: fruit::Model = pear.update(db).await?;

// update many: UPDATE "fruit" SET "cake_id" = "cake_id" + 2
//               WHERE "fruit"."name" LIKE '%Apple%'
Fruit::update_many()
    .col_expr(CakeId, Expr::col(CakeId).add(Expr::val(2)))
    .filter(fruit::Column::Name.contains("Apple"))
    .exec(db)
    .await?;
```
### Save
You can perform "insert or update" operation with ActiveModel, making it easy to compose transactional operations.
```rust
let banana = fruit::ActiveModel {
    id: NotSet,
    name: Set("Banana".to_owned()),
    ..Default::default()
};

// create, because primary key `id` is `NotSet`
let mut banana = banana.save(db).await?;

banana.id == Unchanged(2);
banana.name = Set("Banana Mongo".to_owned());

// update, because primary key `id` is present
let banana = banana.save(db).await?;
```
### Delete
The same ActiveModel API consistent with insert and update.
```rust
// delete one: Active Record style
let orange: Option<fruit::Model> = Fruit::find_by_id(1).one(db).await?;
let orange: fruit::Model = orange.unwrap();
orange.delete(db).await?;

// delete one: repository style
let orange = fruit::ActiveModel {
    id: Set(2),
    ..Default::default()
};
fruit::Entity::delete(orange).exec(db).await?;

// delete many: DELETE FROM "fruit" WHERE "fruit"."name" LIKE '%Orange%'
fruit::Entity::delete_many()
    .filter(fruit::Column::Name.contains("Orange"))
    .exec(db)
    .await?;

```
### Ergonomic Raw SQL
Let SeaORM handle 90% of all the transactional queries.
When your query is too complex to express, SeaORM still offer convenience in writing raw SQL.

The `raw_sql!` macro is like the `format!` macro but without the risk of SQL injection.
It supports nested parameter interpolation, array and tuple expansion, and even repeating group,
offering great flexibility in crafting complex queries.

```rust
let item = Item { id: 2 }; // nested parameter access

let cake: Option<cake::Model> = Cake::find()
    .from_raw_sql(raw_sql!(
        Sqlite,
        r#"SELECT "id", "name" FROM "cake" WHERE id = {item.id}"#
    ))
    .one(db)
    .await?;
```
```rust
#[derive(FromQueryResult)]
struct CakeWithBakery {
    name: String,
    #[sea_orm(nested)]
    bakery: Option<Bakery>,
}

#[derive(FromQueryResult)]
struct Bakery {
    #[sea_orm(alias = "bakery_name")]
    name: String,
}

let cake_ids = [2, 3, 4]; // expanded by the `..` operator

// can use many APIs with raw SQL, including nested select
let cake: Option<CakeWithBakery> = CakeWithBakery::find_by_statement(raw_sql!(
    Sqlite,
    r#"SELECT "cake"."name", "bakery"."name" AS "bakery_name"
       FROM "cake"
       LEFT JOIN "bakery" ON "cake"."bakery_id" = "bakery"."id"
       WHERE "cake"."id" IN ({..cake_ids})"#
))
.one(db)
.await?;
```
