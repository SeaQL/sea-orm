<!--

Welcome! Thank you for reporting bugs!

First of all, please star our repo. Your support is vital to the continued maintenance of SeaORM.

Want to ask a question? You can reach us via:

- Discord: https://discord.com/invite/uCPdDXzbdv
- GitHub Discussions: https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-orm/discussions/new

Please make sure that you are not asking for a missing feature; a bug is incorrect behavior -
either in the feature specification or implementation.

Please also make sure your description is clear and precise - maintainers don't have access to your
code and can't see what you have seen. Please avoid vague descriptions like "they are different"
or "the program crashes" - in either case, provide exact information.

If you are certain there is a bug, please provide a reproducible example, which helps the investigator
to pin-point the bug and the implementor to verify that a solution is satisfactory. Bug reports without 
reproducible example may be closed immediately or dangle forever.

Finally, please search for existing issues and discussions before submission. Feel free to revive old
threads if you have new information to add, but please don't ask for ETA or "+1".
