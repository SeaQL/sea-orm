## Release Notes: SeaORM 2.0.0-rc.25

*(since 2.0.0-rc.24)*

### Bug Fixes

**Restore value system**

Restored the value system across the core crate, drivers (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite), and entity/column types. Refactored executor and query handling for consistency.

**Fix sea-orm-sync**

Aligned `sea-orm-sync` with the restored value system changes in the main crate. Updated drivers, entity types, and executor/query logic to match.

### Improvements

- Bumped `sea-query` to 1.0.0-rc.28
- Updated example projects to use the new release
