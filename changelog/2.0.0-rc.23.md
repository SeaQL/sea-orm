## Release Notes: SeaORM 2.0.0-rc.23

*(since 2.0.0-rc.22)*

### New Features

**`DeriveValueType` implements `IntoActiveValue`** (#2868)

`DeriveValueType` now automatically implements `IntoActiveValue`, so custom value types can be used directly when building ActiveModels without additional boilerplate.

**`IntoActiveValue` for more types**

`IntoActiveValue` is now implemented for additional standard types, improving ergonomics when setting ActiveModel fields.

### Bug Fixes

**Fix sea-orm-sync**

Fixed issues in the `sea-orm-sync` crate.

**Fix sync**

Fixed sync-related bugs.

**Fix tests**

Resolved failing tests.

**Insert many on conflict do nothing returning** (#2389)

Added test coverage and fixes for `insert_many` with `on_conflict_do_nothing` and `returning` clauses.

### Improvements

**Remove `NotU8` trait** (#2868)

The `NotU8` trait has been removed. `DeriveValueType` now handles type constraints internally, simplifying the derive macro.

**Remove `bigdecimal` from default features**

The `bigdecimal` dependency is no longer included in default features, reducing the default dependency footprint. Enable it explicitly if needed.

**CI improvements**

Various CI fixes and improvements.
