## Release Notes: SeaORM 2.0.0-rc.22

*(since 2.0.0-rc.21)*

### New Features

**`DatabaseExecutor` unified executor type** (#2839)

Added a unified `DatabaseExecutor` type that wraps either a `&DatabaseConnection` or `&DatabaseTransaction`. This moves the `SchemaManagerConnection` pattern from `sea-orm-migration` into sea-orm core, providing:

- `DatabaseExecutor` enum for unified handling of connections and transactions
- `IntoDatabaseExecutor` trait for ergonomic conversions
- `SchemaManagerConnection` type alias for backward compatibility
- `SchemaManagerConnectionExt` trait for migration-specific methods

### Bug Fixes

*None in this release.*

### Improvements

**Refactor Value array** (#2849)

Refactored the internal `Value` array handling for improved consistency and maintainability.

**Refactor CI** (#2859)

- Parallelized test compilation for faster CI runs
- Updated `actions/cache` to v5
- Fixed cache keys

**sea-orm-sync example**

Added and improved the `sea-orm-sync` example.

**Update examples**

Updated example code across the repository.
