* Returning by @billy1624 in https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-orm/pull/292

### Breaking Changes
* Refactor `paginate()` & `count()` utilities into `PaginatorTrait`. You can use the paginator as usual but you might need to import `PaginatorTrait` manually when upgrading from previous version.
    ```rust
    use futures::TryStreamExt;
    use sea_orm::{entity::*, query::*, tests_cfg::cake};

    let mut cake_stream = cake::Entity::find()
        .order_by_asc(cake::Column::Id)
        .paginate(db, 50)
        .into_stream();

    while let Some(cakes) = cake_stream.try_next().await? {
        // Do something on cakes: Vec<cake::Model>
    }
    ```
* The helper struct `Schema` converting `EntityTrait` into different `sea-query` statement now has to be initialized with `DbBackend`.
    ```rust
    use sea_orm::{tests_cfg::*, DbBackend, Schema};
    use sea_orm::sea_query::TableCreateStatement;

    // 0.3.x
    let _: TableCreateStatement = Schema::create_table_from_entity(cake::Entity);

    // 0.4.x
    let schema: Schema = Schema::new(DbBackend::MySql);
    let _: TableCreateStatement = schema.create_table_from_entity(cake::Entity);
    ```
* When performing insert or update operation on `ActiveModel` against PostgreSQL, `RETURNING` clause will be used to perform select in a single SQL statement.
    ```rust
    // For PostgreSQL
    cake::ActiveModel {
        name: Set("Apple Pie".to_owned()),
        ..Default::default()
    }
    .insert(&postgres_db)
    .await?;

    assert_eq!(
        postgres_db.into_transaction_log(),
        vec![Transaction::from_sql_and_values(
            DbBackend::Postgres,
            r#"INSERT INTO "cake" ("name") VALUES ($1) RETURNING "id", "name""#,
            vec!["Apple Pie".into()]
        )]);
    ```
    ```rust
    // For MySQL & SQLite
    cake::ActiveModel {
        name: Set("Apple Pie".to_owned()),
        ..Default::default()
    }
    .insert(&other_db)
    .await?;

    assert_eq!(
        other_db.into_transaction_log(),
        vec![
            Transaction::from_sql_and_values(
                DbBackend::MySql,
                r#"INSERT INTO `cake` (`name`) VALUES (?)"#,
                vec!["Apple Pie".into()]
            ),
            Transaction::from_sql_and_values(
                DbBackend::MySql,
                r#"SELECT `cake`.`id`, `cake`.`name` FROM `cake` WHERE `cake`.`id` = ? LIMIT ?"#,
                vec![15.into(), 1u64.into()]
            )]);
    ```
