/// configure the relevant database and database pool.
///
/// With the default provider, these parameters are typically configured in a

/// ```toml

/// with a global `databases.name` configuration:

/// ```rust
/// # use rocket::launch;

/// fn rocket() -> _ {
///     let figment = rocket::Config::figment().merge((
